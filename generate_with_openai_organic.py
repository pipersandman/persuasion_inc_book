VOICE & STYLE:
You're channeling a blend of: Orwell's moral clarity + Rushkoff's rebellious academic + Zuboff's depth + David Foster Wallace's self-aware intelligence + Jon Ronson's wry wit + Chuck Klosterman's philosophical playfulness.

Write as someone who sees both the horror and dark comedy of our technological present. Authoritative but self-aware. The smart friend who's been reading too much Orwell and watching too much Black Mirror.

STRUCTURE (but let it flow organically - these aren't section headers):

START WITH A HOOK that immediately grabs attention:
- Could be: a weird anecdote, a dystopian scenario pushed to absurdity, an uncomfortable observation, a satirical thought experiment
- Make them stop and think "wait, what?"
- Example approaches: "Imagine if..." / "Consider that..." / "Here's something nobody talks about..."

THEN FLOW NATURALLY between these modes (don't label them, just let them emerge):

SERIOUS ANALYSIS: Ground your arguments in reality
- Reference behavioral economics, media theory, surveillance capitalism concepts
- Include data points, historical patterns, psychological mechanisms
- Channel Zuboff's depth and Rushkoff's systemic critique
- Make complex ideas accessible to smart general readers

DARK HUMOR & SATIRE: Let absurdity reveal truth
- When systems are ridiculous, acknowledge it with dry wit
- Use hypothetical scenarios pushed to revealing extremes
- Channel Jon Ronson's wry observations and Charlie Brooker's darkness
- Black Mirror meets Chuck Klosterman's "what if?" thinking

ACADEMIC GROUNDING: Reference actual concepts without being dry
- Mention specific theories, thinkers, or studies naturally
- Translate complex ideas clearly
- Show you've done the homework but keep it conversational

REFLECTIVE INSIGHT: Build to awareness without preaching
- Help readers notice what they've been missing
- Connect dots between seemingly separate phenomena
- Leave them thinking differently, not despairing

END WITH SOMETHING THAT LINGERS:
- Not a neat bow, but a thought that haunts
- Set up curiosity for: {chapter.get('connections', ['the next chapter'])[0]}
- Orwell's urgency + Doctorow's warning, but nuanced

CRITICAL RULES:
1. NEVER use em-dashes (‚Äî or ‚Äì). Use commas, colons, semicolons, or split into sentences.
2. Don't create section headers within the chapter. Let the prose flow.
3. Average sentence length around {self.style['statistics']['avg_sentence_length']:.0f} words, but vary naturally
4. Aesthetic: Minimalist dystopian corporate (think Severance, The Circle)
5. Perspective: First-person "we" (inclusive observer) or third-person analytical

Let the different tones serve the content organically:
- Serious when revealing mechanisms of control
- Satirical when exposing absurdities
- Academic when grounding claims
- Reflective when driving points home

The reader should feel like they're being let in on something important by someone who understands both the gravity and the absurdity of our situation.

TARGET: 2500-3500 words. Write the complete chapter as flowing prose with natural paragraph breaks, not rigid sections.
